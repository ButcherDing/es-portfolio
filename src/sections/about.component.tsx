      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Short version: Former teacher, environmental social-scientist, and
        quadra-glot turned coder. I love learning, coding, building.
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Longer version: I used to travel the world and teach, in far-flung places like Japan, the Persian Gulf, and Latin America. I've always loved languages, and learned Spanish, French, and Japanese along the way. Eventually I decided to pursue a longstanding passion for
        sustainability, and became a social scientist looking at environmental
        issues, particularly surrounding people's values. As much as I love research, I want to do more than just observe, understand, and share knowledge, as important as those things are. I want to create. I have absolutely fallen in love with coding, and I think I can make a bigger impact leveraging tech for social good. There's nothing better than a career that challenges you to learn more every day.`}
